# Diwali Sales Data Analysis

This project aims to analyze Diwali sales data to improve customer experience and sales. The dataset used for this project is a CSV file containing information on the customer's gender, age, state, marital status, occupation, product categories, and purchasing power. The project uses Python's popular data science libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Numpy.

## Requirements

To run this project, the user needs to have Python 3 installed on their system, as well as the following libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

The first part of the project is data cleaning and preprocessing, where the data is loaded from the CSV file, unrelated columns are dropped, missing values are handled, and data types are changed. 

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The second part of the project is exploratory data analysis (EDA), where the distribution of each variable is plotted using various visualization techniques. For instance, count plots, bar plots, and groupby operations are used to analyze the gender distribution, age groups, states, marital status, occupation, and product categories of the customers and their corresponding purchasing power. 

## Insights

The third part of the project is insights, where patterns and insights are identified from the EDA. The insights obtained from the analysis can help improve customer experience by identifying potential customers across different states, occupations, gender, and age groups. The insights can also help improve sales by identifying the most selling product categories and products, which can help plan inventory and meet demand.

## Implementation Details

The project uses Python to perform data analysis and visualization. Data cleaning and preprocessing are performed using pandas and numpy libraries, while exploratory data analysis and insights are performed using seaborn and matplotlib libraries.

Overall, this project provides a detailed and informative example of how data analysis and visualization can be used to improve customer experience and sales. The insights obtained from this analysis can help businesses make data-driven decisions and plan strategies accordingly.
